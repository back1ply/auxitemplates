| -----------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Columns           | Column slides: because sometimes one column just can't handle all that awesome information!        | 18       |
| Processes         | Process slides: because sometimes explaining a process is like herding cats - impossible!          | 13       |
| Timelines         | Timeline slides: visually organize events in chronological order to tell a clear and concise story. | 10       |
| Teams & CVs      | Team and CV slides: introduce team members or showcase individual credentials and accomplishments in a clean and professional design.   | 4        |
| Bullets & Lists   | Bullet slides and lists: present information in a concise and organized manner, breaking down complex concepts into easily digestible chunks.  | 38       |
| Diagrams          | Diagram slides: when you need to prove you're a visual genius, even though you can barely draw a stick figure!   | 4        |
| Charts            | Chart slides: because sometimes numbers are like a foreign language - but with these templates, you'll look like a multilingual data wizard!   | 50       |
| Frameworks        | Framework slides: your trusty sidekick for organizing your thoughts and making you look like a genius, even if you're secretly just winging it!   | 9        |
| Central Elements  | Central slides: like you around chocolate. When several ideas can orbit around a main one.             | 16       |
| Matrices          | Matrix slides: when all ideas are equal, have the same opportunities and potential. Just kidding, when you need to align things in a grid format.   | 2        |
| Venn Diagrams     | Venn Diagrams: when monogamy is no longer cool.                                                     | 8        |
| Tables            | Tables: when you really don't to design visually compelling slides, but just want to get it done with.   | 5        |
| Pyramids          | Pyramids: do we really need to explain this one?                                                     | 3        |
| Quotes            | Quotes: when an expert or your boss wants to come across as Victor Hugo.                              | 6        |
| Other types       | Other types: slides that identify as non binary.                                                     | 8        |
